# Knowledge Schema
<!-- knowledge-lint.js reads ## Work Products and ## Raw Captures to enforce type declarations. Bullet lines matching `- <type>:` are parsed; HTML comment blocks are ignored. -->

<!-- Co-evolve this file with your operator over time.
     Defines what this hermit produces — plumbing, not policy.
     Quality judgments and attention priorities belong in OPERATOR.md or auto-memory. -->

## Work Products
<!-- What domain outputs does this hermit produce?
     For each work product, describe:
     - type: the frontmatter `type` value used in compiled/ filenames
     - trigger: what routine or event produces it
     - format: approximate structure (e.g., bullet summary, narrative, table)
     - location: compiled/<type>-<slug>-<date>.md  (flat — no subdirs)
     Example:
       - briefing: daily intelligence summary across monitored domains.
         Triggered by daily morning routine.
         location: compiled/briefing-<slug>-<date>.md
-->
- note: general-purpose compiled note. location: compiled/note-<slug>-<date>.md

## Raw Captures
<!-- What operational inputs does this hermit collect into raw/?
     For each capture type, describe:
     - type: the frontmatter `type` value used in raw/ filenames
     - feeds: which work products this raw type feeds
     - location: raw/<type>-<slug>-<date>.md  (flat — no subdirs; raw/.archive/ for expired)
     Example:
       - source: fetched articles and RSS items. Feeds briefing.
         location: raw/source-<slug>-<date>.md
       - snapshot: point-in-time data dumps. Feeds weekly reports.
         location: raw/snapshot-<slug>-<date>.md
-->
- input: general-purpose raw capture. location: raw/input-<slug>-<date>.md

## Retention
<!-- How long do different raw types live before archival?
     Reference config.json knowledge.raw_retention_days for the default.
     Example:
       - source: 7 days
       - snapshot: 3 days
-->
